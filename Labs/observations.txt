A difference between Kotlin and Java is how variables are defined. To define a variable in Java, the type of variable is specified 
then the name. Where in Kotlin, it uses val or var to define if the variable is mutable or immutable, which is not used in Java. 
Something else that Kotlin uses that is different from Java is that Kotlin has raw strings which are specified by triple quotes around 
the text. Everything is a raw string will be displayed which is useful for text with multiple lines or to represent specific characters.
